# email-microservice

# Overview
This is a gateway between a REST API and Twilio's SendGrid API. It is meant as a microservice, with some consumer sending data for an email and then receiving a reply back.

# Install
Make sure Go is installed. You can find directions here: https://go.dev/doc/install

Clone this github: 
`git clone htts://github.com/janneyt/email-microservice.git`

Change directories to the cloned repository:
`cd email-microservice`

Initialize the mod system
`go mod init email-microservice.com/m/v2`

Tidy the mod (install dependencies, among many other useful features)
`go mod tidy`

Now you can build the executable:
`go build email-microservice.go`

And then run the microservice like so:
`./email-microservice run`
or on Windows:
`email-microservice run`

# Usage

You must use one of two arguments to run the service. These are the only valid command line arguments for this microservice:

`go run email-microservice.go run` and `go run email-microservice.go help`
